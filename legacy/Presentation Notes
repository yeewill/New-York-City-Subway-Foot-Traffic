Intro
  We are Randy, Will, and Dan. We're sharing our analysis of NYC metro rider volume.
Motivation

Assumptions
  Entries or Exits are more important
  Hit up the places with the most traffic at that time is our goal

Methods
  Collected 2018 full 1 year of turnstile data.
  Removed errors and outliers.
  Consolidated into easier to understand time buckets.
  Analyze weekdays vs saturdays vs sundays.
  For each station and time block, we took the median value across the whole year.
    This helps us eliminate errors in weeks

Results
  Heat maps of the top x stations.
  Here are different heat maps if you consider the tourist index.

Future work
  Test stations and collect data to do better
  Male to female ratios by station zip code
  Group stations by geographical adjacency
